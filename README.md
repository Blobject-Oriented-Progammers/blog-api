Welcome to Blob-ject Oriented Programmers Project!
Our Blog app is designed to allow anyone to come in and view the existing blogs. Allowing only signed
in accounts to be able to make and blog post and comment on blog posts. A signed in user is also allowed
to see other existing posts, same as someone who isnt signed in, but the signed in user can leave comments on other posts.
Simiulating a social media type expierence between users.

List of technologies used -

-- JavaScript, React, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Bootstrap, GitHub

List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations -

-- A very nice ***User Profile Page*** Allowing the user to change their nickname/Username,
moving our change password to this page also. Im sure there are some other user friendly options we could implement.

-- Being able to like/dislike posts and comments as a signed in user. Giving it that real social media feel.

Document your planning, process and problem-solving strategy -

-- Used standups to plan our work, divide if we felt like it that day. A bunch of mob coding without someone
driving (screen sharing) and 2 back seat drivers :)
Not afraid to put issue tickets in to continue making progress, being stuck is no fun. Mainly was able to rely on each
other to figure out the issure/find the bugs.
